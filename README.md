Lets see the codes step by step 

### To extract datas from image i used EASYOCR in this project.To use easyocr you need to install pytorch also.(please see the requirements.txt file)
**Please install requirements.txt.**
#### step:1 
I created a function.py file to create all required function in that file. And imported all required packages
![import](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113424127/223334400-80b05245-e376-4b6f-9d48-c97a36e058f0.png)
#### step:2
I created a function to extract datas from image and to separate all the extracted data using regular expression.(for detailed code see funtion.py file)

#### step:3
To view extracted data in image format i used opencv package to view the Image view of data in app

After creating all the functions i created the streamlit app using the function and its very simple app only.(you can see the app code in app.py file)

### I think this project will be useful to you foster your knowledge in Image data extraction using easyocr AND Happy codingüòÅ
